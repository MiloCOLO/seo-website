# SEO-website

## Description

This is base code for a website designed with search engine optimization while maintaining standards for accessibility. By using modern semantic HTML code, the website is accessible to people using screen readers while browsing the internet. By prioritizing the needs of people without easy access to viewing what's on their screen, the internet can become a more inclusive place. 

I was able to put in the accessibililty by adding alternative descriptions on the images within the code, so when someone uses a screenreader they get a short description of what is on the website. By utilizing a simple alt=" command I was able to write a quick description of what images were on the page they were reading. 

## Usage

This is base code for a marketing website. Having a template to build off of that is already accessibile will be helpful to people going for a user friendly setup. It also has helpful descriptions for what a new marketing team may need when starting up.
